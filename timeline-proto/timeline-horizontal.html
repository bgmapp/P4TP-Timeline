        <h2>World Anti-Slavery Convention</h2>
        <time>June 1840</time> In March 1839, a New York abolitionist newspaper called for a convention to unite the efforts of national anti-slavery forces from around the world. And in the summer of 1840, the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society (BFASS) answered the call. From June 12 to June 23, the General Anti-Slavery Convention, hosted by the BFASS and later known as the World Anti-Slavery Convention, convened at Exeter Hall in London. More than 500 abolitionists from Canada to Mauritius attended the meeting, and the public proceedings attracted around 1,000 spectators daily.
        <br>
        Women were barred from attending the World Anti-Slavery Convention. This prompts Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton to hold a Women's Convention in the US.
